Application for corporate comments.

# What I learned:
- The BEM naming convention which is good for naming classnames for more understandable code.
- Using components. In modern design our website is divided into different reusable components. Learning how to use components is an important aspect of modern design.
- Handling events, like the input event, and using them to make changes with Javascript on the Document Object.
- The form tag, and the textarea tag being better for multiple lines and the input tag being better for single line input.
- The maxlength property for textarea element to specify the maximum length you want your text area to be.
- The spellcheck property for text area i.e(spellcheck="false") to remove those red lines when you spell incorrectly in an input field.
- Correctig default form submission behavior. event.preventDefault()
- .remove() 
- .closest() - In this method, if we want to target an html element using a class name other elements are using, for example a list item sharing a classname, we can do clickedEl = event.target.closest(".feedback")
- .disabled = true.
